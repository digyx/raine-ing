People get really weird when the topic of money comes up. Rather than trying to sniff out how much my coworkers and other people in my industry make, I'd rather share mine so people have an idea of where they sit (and so others can tell me when I'm being underpaid). It's only a single datapoint, but that's much better than no datapoint.

This idea was inspired by [Xe Iaso](https://xeiaso.net/salary-transparency), who does something very similar.

Not including stock options, for simplicity's sake.
