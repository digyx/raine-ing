## Professional Experience

### Atlassian

_Site Reliability Engineer | July, 2021 - Present_

As I joined, Bitbucket had recently completed its transition from the datacenter to AWS. Most of my role such far has been migrating self-hosted services such as RabbitMQ to managed solutions like SQS, automating our quarterly compliance testing, and improving the speed, reliability, and developer experience of our deployment pipelines.

Most of my impact in this job comes from me getting annoyed at a problem and fixing it rather than putting up with the headache.

On the soft skill side, I run our team's Innovation Sprint, a variation on 20% time, as well as our monthly Retros, which have lead to no-meeting Fridays, many experiments to streamline Agile rituals, and biweekly events to make the team feel more connected.
